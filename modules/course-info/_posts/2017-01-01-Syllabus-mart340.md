### GitHub & GitHub Pages
You will store and upload all of your projects and associated resources to GitHub.com, a git repository manager. This will allow for the easy submission of both code, and when possible live examples of your finished assignments via the Internet.



# Policies

### Projects
This will be a primarily project based course. As such, you should plan on completing 3-4 projects this semester (depending on time and course flow). These projects are required and you should be prepared to show/talk about them in class. It is expected that everyone in the class will create and maintain a GitHub.com repo for their assignments.

Deliverables for all projects will include;

- Working Code
- A valid readme.md page describing the briefly describing the project in the projects directory
- A demo video, hosted in youTube and embedded in the readme.md
- A technical report, saved as a PDF and uploaded to the repository.


### Final Project
Class will culminate with final projects. You are expected to push your abilities to produce something that utilizes what you have learned in the class that is useful in some manner to yourself or the world. This should be a more significant project beyond the previous class projects.


### Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. Please inform your teacher via email if you are going to miss a class. Two unexcused absences is cause for failing the class. (An unexcused lateness of 10 minutes or more is equivalent to 1/2 an absence.)


### Participation
This class will be participatory, you are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students both in class and through the digital portals.

Additionally, there will be readings for this course that will be discussed in class. You are expected to be prepared to participate in these discussions. It will be noted if you choose not to, or are unable to participate in such discussions.


### Assessment
Grades will be based primarily on the student’s ability to:
1. Demonstrate an understanding of the specific characteristics and integrative capabilities of the assigned topic in your own words and code.
2. Articulate a clear and concise perspective. Cutting and pasting or copying word for word off the Internet will result in loss of points.
3. Present an organized file/program, as well as blog entry; including proper and punctual delivery of the assignment files.
4. Demonstrate creativity beyond the expected technical requirements.

IMPORTANT: Assignments handed in after the due date and time will have points deducted for lateness. This will be in addition to any points deducted for content. Those that are uploaded late but within one week of the due date will lose 1 point for lateness.  For those uploaded after that, the number of deducted points will be at the discretion of the faculty.


### Grade Break Down   
Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:

- Course Projects (3-4) 50%
- Participation and Attendance 20%
- Final Project 30%

Letter Break Downs;

- A   94-100

## Academic Misconduct and the Student Conduct Code

All students must practice academic honesty. Academic misconduct is subject to an academic penalty by the course instructor and/or disciplinary sanction by the University. All students need to be familiar with the Student Conduct Code. The Code is available online at http://www.umt.edu/vpsa/policies/student\_conduct.php

All work must be your own. Plagarism will be considered unaccaptable. You are free to work together, but you must help each other come up with unique solutions in such cases.

## Changes to the Course
I reserve the right to change the intended content of this course throughout the semester. This may be done to adjust for the speed of the class, to better meet educational goals, or to account for changes in technology.
